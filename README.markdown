##Simple Othello/Reversi Game in Javascript

* This project was created many years ago when I was learning javascript. 
* The game can be accessed by opening the index.html file. 
* It is an example of very basic javascript without any frameworks.
* Maybe some day I'll rework the javascript to function in an unobtrusive manner

The only changes I've made recently were to reorganize the file structure and make sure the main game worked.
